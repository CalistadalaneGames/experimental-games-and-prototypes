About the /AppData/Development/DevMode/ folder
==============================================
This folder should contain any data that you need for development and testing
your project.

For example, you may have large amounts of data that you would normally download
from a website, but in order to develop/test your application without an
internet connection, you could place the necessary files here and copy them to
where they are stupposed to be at runtime.

By default, this folder, and it's contents, is always copied to your project's
output directory.
