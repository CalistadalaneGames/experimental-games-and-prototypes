About the /AppData/Development/IDE/ folder
==========================================
This folder should contain any information that your IDEs need.

Examples:

	MyProjectWorkspace.code-workspace
	VisualStudio.vssettings
	Resharper.DotSettings

By default, this folder is *not* copied to your project's output directory, and
is intended to store notes and temporary information useful for the project's
development.

To use these files, copy/paste their contents into a blank file.
